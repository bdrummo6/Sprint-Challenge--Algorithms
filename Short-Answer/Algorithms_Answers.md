#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity for this code is linear time: O(n). In this code code the `a` increases in proportion to the input 
   value `n`


b) The runtime complexity for this code is quadratic time: O(n^2). Since `j` is raised to the second power in the nested 
   while loop then the runtime complexity is O(n^2) .


c) The runtime complexity for this code is linear time: O(n). Since the recursion decrements `n` then the statements executed 
   are proportional to the input.
