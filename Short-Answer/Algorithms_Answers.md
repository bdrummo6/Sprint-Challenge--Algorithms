#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity for this code is linear time: O(n). In this code code the `a` increases in proportion to the input 
   value `n`


b) The runtime complexity for this code is quadratic time: O(n^2).


c) The runtime complexity for this code is linear time: O(n).
